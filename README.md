# Jets Project

### Description
We were to create a fleet of jets, first imported from a text file.
We were asked to create a menu listing all of the imported jets, a choice to fly all of the jets, view the fastest jet, view the jet with the longest range, load the jet, dog fight, and a choice to add and remove a jet.

### Technologies Used
Some technologies used were, scanner, buffer reader, file reader, parsing, switch statements, if/else, abstraction, interfaces, inheritance, ArrayLists, and arrays.

### Lessons Learned
I think the hardest part of the project was organizing the lay out and figuring out how to parse the text file. Once that was figured out, the rest of the project as pretty linear. I have a better understanding of abstraction, and interfaces.
### What was fun
once the basic layout was finished, creating the menus and adding some creativity was my favorite part.
